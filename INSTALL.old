Basic Installation
==================

These instructions describe building Graphviz using standard make.
To build Graphviz using GNU tools, see ./INSTALL.

 - Run configure.old

 - Edit config.h
    This defines a variety of preprocessor flags describing the system
   on which you are building Graphviz. Comment or uncomment the flags
   as they pertain to your machine.

    In particular, Graphviz relies on a variety of optional, external
   libraries and commands:

     libjpeg - Functions for handling JPEG images.
     libpng  - Functions for handling PNG (portable network graphics) images.
     libz    - A compression library.
     libfreetype - Freetype 2 library for TrueType and other fonts.
     libttf  - Freetype 1 library for TrueType and other fonts.
     curl or wget - tool for transferring files with URL syntax
     libexpat - Functions for parsing XML

   If these are not already on your machine, they are freely
   available on the Internet. You can get the software, install it, and
   then set the appropriate flag. Note that only one of HAVE_LIBFREETYPE 
   and HAVE_LIBTTF should be set. You'll also need to specify where these
   libraries can be found. See EXTLIB_INC and EXTLIB_LIB below.

   Note: You can build Graphviz without these libraries. This will simply
   limit your output formats to various non-bitmap output such as PostScript,
   SVG, HPGL, or Dot.

 - Edit Config.mk. In particular, set:

    ARCH - one of the known OS.
    INSTALLROOT - the directory to which binaries, libraries, documents,
                  etc. should be copied by 'make install'.
    TCLDIR - the root directory of tcl.
    TKDIR - the root directory of tk.
    EXPAT_INC - indicates directory containing expat.h.
    EXPAT_LIB - flags for linking in expat library. 
    EXTLIB_INC - indicates the directories where the include files for
                 the optional libraries such as libjpeg (see above) 
                 can be found, if they are not in the default include 
                 directories. This is a list of -I compiler flags.
    EXTLIB_LIB - indicates which optional libraries to use and which
                 directories to look in. This is a list of -L and -l 
                 compiler flags.

 - Check settings in makearch/$(ARCH).

 - Run make.

After a successful build, the software can be moved to INSTALLROOT
by running:

  make install

To clean up .o files:

  make clean

To remove almost all generated files:

  make distclean
